Freshie,Australia,Nomad Brewing Co.,8,,,"No head, very flat yet very drinkable with a very agreeable flavour. Salt & pepper were very subtle. Really enjoyed it."
Figpucker,Scotland,,5,,,"A ""farmhouse ale"", with honey and figs. Interesting concept, with the ingredients subtly present in the flavour and a dominant malty tast - but poor balance."
Waitrose Belgian Blonde,Belgium,Waitrose @ Du Bocq,8,,,"Surprisingly good for a supermarket brand beer, but it is brewed in Belgium. Very fresh & crisp, with nice flavour. Good blonde!"
Dolina,Spain,Cerveza Dolina,6,,,"Fruity smell, this Spanish take on a Belgian dubbel has quite a nice rich taste, but it seems obvious that it's not quite as good as the real deal."

Beer & Skittles Lager,Scotland,UNKNOWN,6,,,Decent lager.
Big Ben,England,Thwaites,6,,,Ok brown ale.. A bit too strong in the alcohol department to be a standout but otherwise not bad.
Faro Girardin,Belgium,Girardin,7,,,"Sweeti-sh, sour-ish, geuze-ish beer. Decent quality and enjoyable."

Thornbridge Imperial Stout,England,Thornbridge / S:t Eriks,3,,,"Definitely a taste of raspberries and I can appreciate the intention, but what ruins this for me is the strong alcohol taste. I wish this was 3% weaker - such a shame as could be great. Simply didn't enjoy it. "
Colomba,France,Pietra,7,,,"Impeccably smooth & refreshing, this doesn't have a great deal of flavour but is pretty nice."
Virtus,Spain,Cervezas Virtus,7,,,"Fresh, well-carbonated wheat beer with a dry finish. Quite enjoyable. Good beer."

Staropramen,Czech Republic,Staropramen (MolsonCoors),6,,,Pleasant lager but doesn't stand out particularly.

Viru,Lithuania,A. Le Coq (Olvi),,,,

St Feuillien Blonde,Belgium,St-Feuillien,8,,,"Good, solid satisfying blonde with slightly peppery taste."

Corsendonk Xmas,Belgium,Corsendonk @ Du Bocq,8,,,"Very dark, rich, slightly spiced ale. Great winter warmer and good quality beer."
Jupiler,Belgium,Piedboeuf (AB InBev),6,,,"Mainstream lager, but not bad by world standards. Decent malty character and good texture.."

Wildcard Blonde,England,Wild Card,7,,,"Good quality blonde, a bit hoppy. Nice."
Sam Smith's Imperial Stout,England,Samuel Smith,8,,,"Bold, rich stout with chocolatey flavour. Smooth and with excellent balance, this is a very good imperial stout. "

X.XI,France,Lancelot,8,,,"A decent barley wine, with the alcohol strength well disguised. The taste is rich and deep, and it's well balanced. Very nice."
Sam Smith's Wheat,England,Samuel Smith,7,,,"A good wheat beer with typical flavours of banana etc. However, overshadowed by the quality of the German wheats. Still, a solid, refreshing effort."
Achel Blonde,Belgium,Trappistenabdij De Achelse Kluis,9,,,"Fruity, dry, hoppy blonde. Doesn't taste strong and has great balance. Great!"
St Bernardus Triple,Belgium,St. Bernardus,8,,,Great quality triple. Softer than the Achel but similar. Almost perfectly formed.
Ultramour,Belgium,Ecaussinnes,5,,,"Fruit beer with sweet candied smell. Taste was a bit strange, and reminded me of a sugar free raspberry yoghurt. Surely they didn't use sweetener?! Otherwise ok."
Stewart 80,Scotland,Stewart,6,,,"Very drinkable fruity, malty beer. Pleasant."
BrewDog Born To Die,Scotland,BrewDog,8,,,"Very full on with the hops, but with a nice fruitiness rather than being overly bitter. Rich & complex, really packs a punch."

Kriek Mariage Parfait (2014),Belgium,F. Boon,7,,,"Crisp, tart & well-carbonated, barely tastes of alcohol despite the strength. Very refreshing, I feel I could enjoy this even more once I'm more accustomed to the style."
Framboise Boon (2013),Belgium,F. Boon,7,,,"Crisp & tart, with nice raspberry aroma and faintly sweet. Cordial-like but a good strength of ABV to make it interesting."
Kellerbier,Germany,Köstritzer Schwarzbierbrauerei (Bitburger),5,,,"Brown in colour, crisp/carbonated with subtle flavours. There's a slight hoppy bitterness there but otherwise a bit bland. Drinkable nonetheless."
St Feuillien Brune,Belgium,St Feuillien,8,,,"Solid brown beer; very smooth, slightly sweet with the alcohol barely noticeable."
Raspberry Dog Chew,Scotland,Fallen,8,,,"Building upon the already very nice Chew Chew, this one has been enhanced with raspberries and is a more impressive beast. Fruity and thick, it's like a pudding in a glass and a very enjoyable one at that. It's 10% ABV is very well disguised by the rich, lovely flavour."
Chimay Triple/Cinq Cents,Belgium,Chimay,8,,,Smooth & easy to drink with a yeasty/spiced taste and good amount of sediment in the bottle. Great beer.
St Feuillien Cuvée de Noel,Belgium,St Feuillien,8,,,"Sadly lost a bit when I opened the bottle. Volatility aside, this is a great beer, with liquorice, treacle & spice flavours. Excellent balance and rich flavour."
I&G Rum Cask,Scotland,Innis & Gunn @ Wellpark,7,,,"I'm not a big rum fan but it definitely makes this an interesting beer with a rich, dark taste."

Rabbie's Porter,Scotland,Ayr,7,,,Decent porter with coffee flavour.
Top Out Winter 2015,Scotland,Top Out,8,,,"A very rich brew, smoky and fruity, with some sweetness. Tastes quite thick as well. Has a great complexity and balance. Excellent winter beer."
Pale Duke,Scotland,Drygate,6,,,"Big foamy head, well carbonated yet smooth pale ale, this had a very fresh, hop-dominated taste and was bitter - enjoyable, certainly not bland."
Affligem Tripel,Belgium,Affligem (Heineken),8,,,"Fairly standard Belgian triple - in that it's of a high quality and very enjoyable, with the high ABV being well disguised."
Spoum,France,Artisanale Touken,7,,,"Blackberry beer. Not much carbonation but the smell and taste are rich in fruits. Good balance of flavour and a rich, enjoyable beer."
Duchesse Anne Triple Hops,France,Lancelot,7,,,Hoppy in a good way; not very bitter with fruity/floral aroma/taste and lots of sediment in the bottle. Very pleasant beer.
La Goudale,France,De Gayant (Saint-Omer),7,,,"Fresh, sweetish, enjoyable beer. Didn't taste well due to man flu."
Hoegaarden Grand Cru,Belgium,Hoegaarden (AB InBev),8,,,Like a triple but with added oomf; wheats flavours and great balance overall.
Brigantine,France,De La Côte de Jade,7,,,I recall this had a nice flavour and was surprisingly well-balanced for a French beer!
Super U Blonde,France,UNKNOWN,7,,,"An enjoyable, smooth & very drinkable blonde. Another example of a supermarket brand beer surpassing expectations."
3 Monts,France,St. Sylvestre,8,,,"Good carbonation and foam presence. Strong, but with a great balance of hops & malt and has a great character, which is especially evident in the aftertaste. Excellent beer."
Jenlain Blonde,France,Duyck,7,,,"Sweet and slightly bitter, citrus taste, like it's mixed with grapefruit juice. Lacking complexity but a solid tasting and good beer with assertive character."
Saint Colombe Ambrée,France,Sainte Colombe,5,,,Flat and toffee-coloured. Not impressive but it has a subtle caramel taste and is very drinkable.
Ours Pale Ale,France,De L'Ours,3,,,"Highly carbonated, this tastes a bit like the brewer chucked some water, malt, yeast etc into a bucket and hopes for the best. Just doesn't taste as if the ingredients are combined to make a cohesive whole. Has an aftertaste of - essentially - fizzy water."
Grimbergen Noel,Belgium,Kronenbourg (Carlsberg),7,,,"Sweet and slightly industrial tasting, this lacks the richness and character typically found in other Belgian Xmas beers. That said, still quite enjoyable and by no means bad."
Ours Stout,France,De L'Ours,3,,,"Again, the palate is dominated by carbonated water. Flavour seems to play second fiddle in what is not a good beer."
Pere Noel,Belgium,De Ranke,8,,,"Yeasty, slightly sweet amber-coloured ale. Has an excellent balance and pleasant fizzy mouthfeel."
Queen of the Night,Mexico,,6,,,"Good balance of hops/malt, make for an interesting, subtle flavour."
Bière Ovalie,France,Duyck,6,,,"Crisp, refreshing, slightly sweet blonde beer. Good."
Ours Miel,France,De L'Ours,4,,,"Smelled like something from the medicine cabinet, didn't taste a lot better. Some subtle taste of honey but a bit overly carbonated. While poor, slightly better than the others."
Payesa,Spain,Payesa Cervecera S.L @ Cerveses La Gardènia,7,,,"Amber-coloured ale with a full-bodied rich flavour, with malts et al. Excellently balanced and very enjoyable."
Reissdorf Kolsch,Germany,Privat-Brauerei Heinrich Reissdorf,7,,,Very pleasant; light & malty; the sort of beer you could drink several of in one sitting.
St Colombe Grand Cru,France,Sainte Colombe,7,,,Dark with no head. Rich chocolatey/nutty/liquorice flavour. Despite the 10% ABV this was pleasant to drink.
Oud Beersel Framboise,Belgium,Oud Beersel,7,,,"Crisp and tart with pure red colour. Light, refreshing and barely sweet at all."
Fantome Dark White,Belgium,Fantome,8,,,"Obviously spicy; dominated by a peppery taste. The lasting impression is of bitterness. That said, it's packed with kick and character and feels great I'm the mouth, similar to other Fantome beers. A very enjoyable saison style beer with peppery edge."
Spaghetti Western,Italy,Brewfist / Prairie Artisan Ales,8,,,"Smooth, rich chocolate & coffee stout. Tastes very nice indeed, a bit like dessert in a glass."
Damh Ban,Scotland,Ayr,6,,,Hoppy but with a pleasant counterbalance of other ingredients.

Towzie Tyke,Scotland,Ayr,7,,,"Crisp and fresh on the palate, it's an enjoyable golden ale with character."
Plum Porter,England,Titanic,6,,,"Very fruity smell, but taste is more bitter and less sweet than that might suggest. Overall an enjoyable beer with hops and fruit combining to good effect."
Bill's,Scotland,Caledonian (Heineken),7,,,"Nice aroma, this is a very pleasant pale ale with good balance and a flavour that is never dull."
13 Guns,England,Thwaites,7,,,"Fruity aroma, and an interesting and complex flavour. Definitely tastes like a mix of different hops. Very enjoyable."
Dark Side of Wheat,Spain,Cervezas Virtus,6,,,"Brown, with nice fruity, caramel smell. To taste, although drinkable, it is a little watery and incomplete-tasting, but it does have a pleasant caramel and malt flavour. Ok."
Maibock,Canada,Les Trois Mousquetaires,7,,,"Cloudy amber, taste is malty and slightly sweet like honey. Quite strong alcohol but not unpleasant. Quite a good beer."
Nest Beer White Ale,Japan,Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino),6,,,"Subtle and a bit flat, but quietly confident, like you might imagine a Japanese man of honour. Overall a pleasant, refreshing beer with a hint of orange and spice."
Carolus Christmas,Belgium,Het Anker,9,,,"Very dark, rich, smooth. Liquorice, spices, Xmas pud. Sweet, but not too sweet. High ABV but extremely well hidden. Beautiful balance. Excellent."
Mikkeller Milk Stout,Denmark,Mikkeller @ De Proefbrouwerij,6,,,"Overall smooth and a decent stout, but for me there was something - a bitterness? - there that was a bit strong. Hence the balance was a bit of a let down."
Green Gold,Denmark,Mikkeller @ De Proefbrouwerij,7,,,Hoppy beer with strong amber colour and very carbonated. A mix of fruitiness and bitterness due to the hops. Full of character and very enjoyable.
De Koninck,Belgium,De Koninck (Duvel Moortgat),7,,,"By Belgian standards, a weak beer, but this is an amber pale ale of over 5%. Has a nice malty character with a bit of sweetness there too. Good beer, and I'm sure the reputed unpasteurised draft version would be well worth seeking out."
Midnight Sun,Scotland,Williams Bros.,8,,,Smooth black porter with toasted malt flavours. The addition of ginger and oats works well and makes for an well-rounded and very enjoyable flavour overall.
Yardbird IPA,England,Greene King,7,,,"Good quality IPA, well balanced."
Beavertown Smog Rocket,England,Beavertown,7,,,"Interesting stout, full of flavour and character."
Lagunitas IPA,USA,Lagunitas Brewing Co. (Heineken),8,,,Strong IPA which appears to make great use of hops. A mix of fruity and bitter which makes overall a very satisfying brew - but don't drink too many at once!
Top Out Smoked Porter,Scotland,Top Out,7,,,"Bottle from Royal Mile whisky shop. Smooth, dark porter with rich coffee and smoked notes. Highly drinkable and with an overall satisfying flavour. Good cold weather beer."
Eden Mill Whisky Beer,scotland,Eden Mill,6,,,Creamy smell/taste and creamy in the mouth. A good balance of whisky flavour to the beer and a decent brew overall but not outstanding.
Straffe Hendrik Quad,Belgium,Halve Maan,9,,,"Good head on this. The taste is that of rich dark fruits, and the 11% alcohol is very well hidden indeed. If it wasn't Wednesday I may have drank a second one. Excellent."
Monks Stout,Belgium,Dupont,6,,,"Quite a good, if watery stout with an earthy flavour."
Vichtenaar,Belgium,Verhaeghe,8,,,"Weak by Belgian standards, a sweet & sour beer that has an excellent balance of both and is very drinkable and refreshing indeed."
Nogne O Imperial Brown,Norway,Nøgne Ø (Hansa Borg),7,,,"Perhaps a tad strong but overall a rich brown ale, with distinct flavour."
Fantome Tonka,Belgium,Fantome,7,,,"Could taste the spices a bit, but not as much as expected. Anyway, an interesting and unusual blend but it works well. Unique and moreish."
Marmalade On Rye,Scotland,Tempest,6,,,"Disappointed by how strong this was. I get the flavour, especially of the orange zest, but just feel this could be so much better. Got another bottle for 2nd opinion."
Nest Pale Ale,Japan,Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino),7,,,Quite a weak flavour but unmistakably a pale ale. Very easy to drink and pleasant on the palate. Understated.
Dublin Porter,Ireland,St. James’s Gate (Diageo),4,,,Typical burnt malt and coffee flavours but quite weak and not much to write home about.
Pilot Christmas,Scotland,Pilot,8,,,"Very impressed by this quad. Interesting blend of ingredients. Too strong for some but I found the alcohol very well disguised and this beer to be rich, fruity and immensely satisfying."
Pie Noir,France,Sainte Colombe,6,,,"A little watery and unfinished-tasting, but the smoked malt flavour - although subtle - wins over in the end and this turns out to be an enjoyable beer."
Gilden Kolsch,Germany,Kölner Verbund Brauereien,6,,,"Typical kolsch; not much to say other than it has the expected light malty taste and is a refreshing, satisfying beer."
Krusovice,Czech Republic,Královský Pivovar Krušovice (Heineken),6,,,Decent pilsner. Light yet full-bodied with enjoyable malt character. Could easily drink several in one sitting.
La Dalmatienne,Belgium,Fantome,8,,,"Mix of strong citrus, tea and spice flavours. Not as big a head as other Fantomes. Overall an interesting, enjoyable blend and another fascinating beer from Fantome."

UnaRubia,Spain,,6,,,"Amber-coloured, crisp, refreshing, light, hoppy ale. Pleasant overall."
La Loca Juana,Spain,,6,,,"Amber and full bodied, flavour of caramel and roasted malts."
Black Virtus,Spain,,6,,,"Smooth yet crisp, coffee aroma/flavour, hints of vanilla. Quite strong lingering taste. Perhaps could do with more depth/balance but overall it's quite good."
Happy Otter,Spain,,8,,,"Great bouquet of floral hops, hint of maltiness, great balance. It's all about the hops but there's enough going on to make it a very satisfying pale ale."
ZZ+,Spain,,7,,,"Very hoppy amber ale, reminiscent of Brew Dog. Solid combination of hops and caramel sweetness."
La Vache Folle,Spain,,7,,,"High carbonation, citrussy, hoppy. Quite refreshing with hint of grapefruit. Unusual."
Cerveza Mica,Spain,,7,,,"Subtle tasting beer with lightly toasted aroma and flavour. Easy to drink and enjoyable, I'd have it again."
Mahou Maestra,Spain,,7,,,"Nice toasted malt flavour, like 1906 Reserva? Good."
Koperwiek,Spain,,5,,,Standard supermarket lager but it was enjoyable enough and preferable to Tennents or Fosters.
Argus,Spain,,6,,,"Lager made for Lidl, Spain? For a canned lager it had a nice body of flavour."
Torquemada 25,Spain,,4,,,"barnyard smell, wierd sour/bitter taste. Overall I still enjoyed but it's not great."
Four Lions IPA,Spain,,7,,,"good IPA, with nice fruity character. Well balanced and pretty good quality (surprising for Spain!)"
Four Lions Wheat,Spain,,7,,,"crisp and subtle, with a lingering wheaty flavour and overall it was rather nice."
Four Lions Coffee Stout,Spain,,7,,,"fruity smell. Very much a stout, very much coffee flavoured; fruitiness/bitterness combine to make something original. It's a subdued bitterness and the pronounced coffee notes make sure it does exactly what it says on the tin."
Brew Indie Brown Ale,Spain,,5,,,"coffee/roasted flavour, slight bitter taste. Ok but a bit unbalanced - too bitter?"
Brew Indie American Golden Ale,Spain,,6,,,"good head, cloudy yellow. Has a crisp, citrus hoppy taste to it and is quite refreshing, if slightly unbalanced."
Zerep Tostada,Spain,,6,,,"fruity, malty, slightly sweet strong ale. Enjoyable but has perhaps a lingering alcohol presence that overstays its welcome in the mouth."
Alhambra Negra,Spain,,5,,,slight roasted malt flavour which is pleasant. Tasted a bit mass-produced but otherwise it's ok.
Peregrina Blonde,Spain,,4,,,"had a sort of weak, bitter taste that didn't really work for me (it was a lot like that rice ale). Not too bad, but not for me."
Kadabra Belgian White,Spain,,7,,,very crisp and refreshing with pleasant citrus body. I didn't think there was a lot going on with the flavour but it was so crisp and refreshing.
Four Lions Lager,Spain,,7,,,"earthy smell, full-bodied, slightly creamy with a malty flavour. Overall pretty satisfying and balanced."
Four Lions Brown Ale,Spain,,6,,,"fruity/earthy smell, rich creamy body. It's pleasant to drink but with a treacly/strong lingering taste that might not appeal to everyone."
Ribada,Spain,,5,,,"slightly sour, fruity, nutty? A bit wine-like, it was interesting but I wasn't sure what to make of it. Would try again."
Aora Tostada,Spain,,7,,,"Belgian-style strong ale with slightly fruity, toasty flavour. It was rather enjoyable."
Kadabra IPA,Spain,,6,,,quite fruity strong IPA but the taste was a little too strong with alcohol. Still interesting.
1923 Red,Spain,,5,,,Easy to drink and ok but doesn't live up to the billing.
St Feuillien Saison,Belgium,,8,,,well-rounded balanced saison with mixture of fruity and hoppy flavour. Very satisfying. Must try more!
Barbar Bok,Belgium,,7,,,"strong dark malty ale, with the honey flavour only subtle yet it provides a sweet, strong backbone which is borderline too strong - but overall it works well."
Pietra,France,,6,,,subtle but well balanced taste; nutty and a bit bitter. It's quite an enjoyable beer.

Macbeth,Scotland,,7,,,Light & fruity pale ale.. Quite subtle yet with a very interesting taste.
Quetsche Tilquin,Belgium,,8,,,"light brown/purplish colour, sour smell/taste, tart with vinegar, apples. Very crisp and drinkable, cider-like. Enjoyable."
Jenlain Ambrée,France,,7,,,"well-balanced strong amber, which has a good malt presence, a pleasant, subtle fruit/bitter taste and a hint of citrus (a bit like the blonde)."
Broughton ???Ale???,Scotland,,6,,,Decent IPA with good malt presence.
Kick Off Summer Ale,Scotland,,7,,,"fruity, malty and fresh, with slight bitterness, this was good stuff (similar to Bill's)."
EPA,Scotland,,6,,,"malty ale, quite nice but not as good as the Kick Off."
Northbound 33,Northern Ireland,,6,,,"dark, malty beer with a rich flavour. It's good but not my preferred style."
La Rulles Blonde,Belgium,,9,,,"cloudy yellow, rich silky head and a very well balance and easy to drink blonde. For me really hit the spot and was just about perfect."
Paulaner Muncher Dunkel,Germany,,7,,,"malty, fruity, crisp. Decent dunkel."
Bonnets Rouges,France,,6,,,"saison-like, with a light hoppiness, and an assertive fruit presence provides a nice complement and balance, for an enjoyable brew."
Sainte-Colombe Blonde,Belgium,,6,,,"fresh, saison-like blonde, with pleasant light hoppiness and refreshing."
Dramm Hud,France,,7,,,"strong yet alcohol well masked, and very well balanced. A bit of sweetness and hoppiness, and overall it's pretty good stuff."
Grimbergen Blanche,Belgium,,7,,,"nice, fresh & slightly fruity wheat beer, à la Kronenbourg Blanche."
Pelforth Brune,France,,9,,,"rich and slightly sweet, this exceptionally-balanced brew really hit the spot and I'd rate it among Belgium's finest (perhaps I'm biased to this style). A real surprise coming from France."
Sainte-Colombe Dorée,France,,7,,,wheat beer that is a decent example of the style and is well rounded and refreshing.
Brigantine Ambrée,France,,5,,,"malty, slightly hoppy and with an almost citrus taste, this is interesting but a bit unbalanced, leaving a slightly bitter taste. This isn't an issue though, as it's just on the right side of interesting."
Super des Fagnines,Belgium,,7,,,decent blonde with a herbal taste.
Sainte-Colombe Blanche,France,,6,,,a refreshing wheat beer but probably less well-formed or satisfying than the Dorée.
Skumenn Wheat IPA,France,,6,,,"decent kick of hops, making this interesting and overall bitter. The wheat definitely adds something, can't quite put my finger on it. Good beer."
Sineke,Belgium,,7,,,"hoppy and with a slight citrus fruit presence, similar to a pale ale, this is well balanced, bitter yet refreshing."
Swannay Island Hopping,Scotland,,7,,,easy to drink with a nice flavour of cereal malt and light bitterness. Good quality brew.
Qantelaar MM,Belgium,,7,,,"dark brown colour, taste is a bit sour, crisp and tangy, backed up by the whiskey presence. It's unusual, interesting and very enjoyable. Makes me think of flawed genius."
Tilting Ale,England,,6,,,Good pale ale but nothing special.
Meantime Raspberry Wheat,England,,7,,,"tart, refreshing. Didn't try much but will give it the benefit of the doubt."
Meantime Wheat,England,,8,,,"smooth, creamy, fruity. A very nice brew, easily my favourite from Meantime."
Meantime Lager,England,,6,,,not bad but a bit of harsh bitterness.
Meantime Pale Ale,England,,6,,,"a bit of fruitiness, it was ok."
Meantime African Queen(?),England,,6,,,"quite a strong pale ale-ish beer but overall was a bit too strong and imbalanced, despite being fairly decent and drinkable."
Steigl Goldbrau,,,6,,,"sweetish, malty lager(?). A bit like a less subtle kolsch. Pleasant to drink but nothing that really stands out."
Crazy Donkey,Greece,,7,,,"smooth, strong, full-bodied, bitter. A bit much at first but part way through the 750ml bottle, my taste adapted and overall it was enjoyable."
Gauloise Brune,Belgium,,7,,,"strong, rich, sweet, licquorice-flavoured, slightly spiced. Good but there are better brunes out there."
Skumenn Pale Ale,France,,6,,,"nicely hopped pale ale, cloudy and always interesting, with a pleasant bitterness. Solid effort, although some room for improvement."
Fantome de Tous Les D'Iables,Belgium,,9,,,"strong orange colour, rich and full bodied. The alcohol is supremely well masked here and the taste is quite fruity with some bitterness, reminding me of a sweet grapefruit juice - rich in the mouth. Overall balance with combination of sugar and spices is great! Very good!"
Long White Cloud,Scotland,,7,,,
Arran Black IPA,Scotland,,5,,,"coffee bitterness typical of a porter is present in the aroma and taste, but there's not so much evidence of IPA and the taste is a bit imbalanced towards alcohol strength and bitterness for my liking. Otherwise it's not bad."
Fallen New World Odyssey,Scotland,,8,,,"cloudy, fresh and hoppy in a very nice way, with light bitterness and fruitiness. The balance here is excellent and it tastes like the work of a master craftsman."
Arran Blonde (Draught),Scotland,,7,,,"has an earthiness/fruitiness about it. Body is smooth, with pleasant maltiness/citrus flavour. Pretty satisfying on draught, especially after climbing Goatfell!"
Haggis Hunter,Scotland,,6,,,"pleasant crisp ale with light fruitiness and bitterness, it's good but not outstanding."
La Rulles Brune,Belgium,,8,,,"smooth, rich stout with a near perfect equilibrium of coffee bitterness, sweetness and agreeable acidity. I'm sure more tasting would reveal hidden depths but on this evidence, very impressed."
Hofbrau Muncher Weisse,Germany,,7,,,"nice wheat beer, with light banana presence. BB Dec 2014 but it was still nice and refreshing."
Skumenn Amber,France,,,,,didn't have much but it was crisp and interesting.
Skumenn Rye IPA,France,,7,,,"a strength like a strong Belgian ale, and with the qualities of a strong fruity IPA, this was very enjoyable and perhaps my favourite from Skumenn."
Arran Milestone,Scotland,,6,,,"strong amber ale, tastes like it was matured in casks of some kind. Taste is sweet and malty; the strong malty cereal flavour is promising but doesn't seem to go anywhere more interesting."
Arran Guid Ale,Scotland,,4,,,"bitterness dominates the taste here - in fact I think it's a bitter. Hint of fruitiness and passable, but I'm not really a fan."
Tempest Farmhouse,Scotland,,7,,,"very crisp, dirty, earthy taste, slightly sour. Interestingly tangy/citrussy. That combination of citrus and earthiness works pretty well and makes for a brew that is very interesting and quite satisfying."
Schneider Weisse Tap 5,Germany,,8,,,"sweet, candy-like, alcohol well hidden, as expected. Rich and slightly malty, with a slight kick of hops. So smooth and pure tasting - be careful it creeps up on you!"
Hofbrau Dunkel,Germany,,6,,,"slightly sweet, with toasted malt flavour. Good but I imagine better if on draught/not 1.5 years past the use by date."
Hofbrau Schwarze Weisse,Germany,,7,,,"dark, crisp, malty, wheaty and well balanced. Enjoyable despite being so much past the use by date."
Coulls,Scotland,,6,,,"light, crisp, citrussy, refreshing - but not very exciting. Would be a great hot weather beer."
Barney's Red Rye,Scotland,,6,,,"Smooth, creamy & malty, well defined flavour. Slightly bitter."
Schiehallion,Scotland,,7,,,
Estrella Damm,Spain,,5,,,"Unexciting, basic lager but has a pleasant lingering malty finish and is a good thirst quencher."
Bersalis Kadet,Belgium,,7,,,"tastes triple-like, but weaker, slightly bitter and citrussy. Crisp, refreshing and tangy. Smooth yeastiness in the background? Overall quite satisfying."
Nitro Milk Stout,USA,,8,,,"very smooth, thin in consistency, but has a brilliantly balanced flavour of milky coffee and a hint of chocolate. Quality stuff."
Aventinus Eisbock,Germany,,8,,,"dark, smooth, rich, warming alcohol. Sweet flavour of marzipan/banana, spices. Quite alcoholic but still pleasantly so. Great beer."
Mongozo Buckwheat,Belgium,,7,,,"crisp, citrussy and refreshing, this pale beer hits the spot. Not particularly complex but the pleasant citrus taste is a success."
Sambrooks Pale Ale,,,6,,,"very crisp, slightly fruity/bitter ale. Nothing particularly new here but its crispness is probably the thing that stands out the most. Decent."
Kagua Red,Japan,,7,,,"rich, Belgian-style amber ale, fruity, slightly spicy (was that the wasabi?) and strong. All in all, a quality beer."
Kagua White,Japan,,8,,,"lemony scent and very pale colour. Palate is crisp sweetness and refreshing, with hints of citrus. Tastes more like a strong, citrussy lager than a wheat beer to me. Overall I'm very impressed by how good this was."
Top Out South Face,Scotland,,6,,,"red colour, rich head, fruity scent. Slightly fruity taste, bitterness in the aftertaste, strong but not overwhelming alcohol taste. Reminds me of The Cone. I think the strength is a little too much and this is almost a very good beer."
B-Side Double IPA,,,7,,,"1/3 in BrewDog bar, infused with blackberries, raspberries, cinnamon & ginger. First off, it's strong, but alcohol reasonably well hidden. Aroma is very pleasant as you'd expect. The fruits of the forest are definitely evident in the taste. I think overall the added ingredients make it work, as the end result is a strong yet rich and fruity brew."
Imperialist,Belgium,,7,,,"foamy head which disappears quickly, and cloudy amber appearance like a wheat beer. Crisp, fizzy mouthfeel. Quite strong alcohol taste, yet quite flat in flavour. Overall though it's a nice flavour; a bit of citrus, a bit of caramel."
Windswept Wheat,Scotland,,8,,,"very cloudy, drinkable beer with strong banana smell/taste. Very I enjoyable."
Wooha(?) Wheat,Scotland,,8,,,"not a typical wheat beer, with hoppy bitterness/malts. It's interesting, well-balanced and a pleasure to drink."
Fallen Platform C,Scotland,,7,,,good well balanced IPA. The balance was key here.
West Dunkel,Scotland,,7,,,"enjoyable dark lager, went down a treat."
Byron Lager,England,,6,,,straightforward lager as accompaniment to food. Good fizz/malt character. Fine by me.
Corsendonk Agnus Tripel,Belgium,,7,,,"a decent tripel, don't remember the specifics."
Pundie,Scotland,,5,,,"light head, light body, interesting & unusual. Smells alcoholic. Slightly bitter, slightly strong alcohol taste. Overall enjoyable, with a grainy aroma/taste, but perhaps too strong and singularly bitter."
Krusovice Malvaz,Czech Republic,,7,,,"strong and amber-coloured, this is quite bitter but really well balanced and full of character. Very satisfying."
Krusovice Musketyr,Czech Republic,,6,,,"amber colour, with hoppy bitter taste and slight malt flavour. While not exciting the balance is good and the end result is satisfying."
Krosovice Wheat,Czech Republic,,6,,,"quite prominent banana small/taste, but a bit watery as a whole. That said, still an enjoyable beer."
Staropramen 11,Czech Republic,,7,,,"on draft, was well rounded with good character. Decent lager taste which was well balanced. Found it very enjoyable."
Kozel Cerny,Czech Republic,,6,,,"light, crisp with hint of coffee, a bit less boring than its light sibling. Despite the lack of excitement it's pleasant and refreshing. It reminds me of Coke but with the sugar removed."
"Krusovice ""11""",Czech Republic,,6,,,pale ale-ish with malts in the flavour. Not exactly sure what this is but it's ok by me.
"Krusovice ""Black & Tan""",Czech Republic,,7,,,rich amber beer with nice malt character. Enjoyable! This is probably the 13.
??? Richnov ??? Marzen,Czech Republic,,8,,,"Crisp, malty, smooth amber ale. Faint bitterness but nice malt/sweet character and very enjoyable indeed!"
Chodovar Skalni Lezak,Czech Republic,,6,,,"amber beer with decent foamy head. Difficult to know what it is, but is crisp and lager-like with a nice malty character. Very drinkable."
The Pale Armadillo,Scotland,,7,,,"cloudy yellow, hoppy and citrussy pale ale that is well-balanced. Enjoyable stuff."
Pissenlit,Belgium,,8,,,"tastes like other Fantomes I've had, it's citrussy and spicy with a strong amber colour and the alcohol is very well disguised. Can't really taste the dandelion but it's got a flavour full of character and doesn't disappoint!"
Gilden Kolsch,Germany,,6,,,"less of a malt presence than other kolsch, but with a slight fruitiness. One of my less favourite but still ok."
Morgane,France,,6,,,"it had a healthy head and is cloudy with plenty sediment. As well as appearance, the flavour is similar to that of a wheat beer, with hints of banana etc. However, this has more of a cereal, barley-like taste than a wheat beer. At times, there's the sense of fizzy water in the mouth but generally, enjoyable enough."
Vanilla Shake,Denmark,,,,,"unwittingly cracked this open on a Monday evening, not realising the % - it's very strong! Definite smell of coffee and vanilla. To taste it's a bit strong but gradually it becomes more drinkable. Rich coffee flavour with some vanilla and hint of chocolate. It's got a thick and creamy texture and hence lives up to its name."
No Label,Scotland,,6,,,tastes more like a pale ale to me than a kolsch. Subtle hops and fruitiness combine to make a refreshing but confused-tasting beer. I feel the maltiness that should be in a kolsch is mainly washed away by the fruit flavour.
Northbound 08,North Ireland,,7,,,subtle flavour but very crisp and satisfying.
Wooha Lager,Scotland,,7,,,"very unusual, cloudy with fruity smell and earthy, slightly bitter, malty taste. I enjoyed it, certainly interesting and unique."
Czech Craft Lager,Czech Republic,,7,,,"strong well-balanced lager, with hint of sweetness. Satisfying."
Angelo Poretti,Italy,,6,,,"Whistle Binkies, draft. Decent lager, but don't remember much more."
Pelicon Stout,Slovenia,,6,,,"coffee aroma with coffee taste and a slight creaminess, although a bit thin. Overall quite nice."
St Giles,Scotland,,7,,,decent 80 shilling-style ale. Good malt character and enjoyable to drink.
85 Shilling,Scotland,,6,,,"dark with rich creamy head, coffee/smoky/dark malty taste. Threatens to be something special."
Cranachan Stout,Scotland,,8,,,"tart raspberry flavour combined with whisky flavours. Rich and strong in alcohol yet the balance on this is great. Can't fault it, I want more!"
Bad Day At the Office,Scotland,,6,,,"good, but not great, amber hoppy ale (bitter?). Perfectly ok."
Talisman,Scotland,,7,,,"crisp, light & refreshing lager with a bit of citrus. Enjoyable."
Golf Inn,Scotland,,6,,,fruity/bitter/hoppy combo in a nicely balanced ale. Well made but not exciting.
Innis & Gunn Lager,Scotland,,6,,,"decent, slight fruity lager. Very drinkable. Rather nice."
Frontier Lager,,,6,,,"a solid, crisp, malty lager."
Kowabunga,,,7,,,smooth creamy pale ale with fruity/hoppy flavour in a perfectly balanced marriage. Very good.
Leffe Brune,Belgium,,6,,,"decent strong brown ale, but had a sweetish, slightly industrial taste which let it down slightly."
McGuffin Lager,,,6,,,"Filmhouse lager. Crisp yet with smooth, creamy head. A bit citrussy, slightly sweet with faint malts. Not bad."
Alhambra Reserva,Spain,,6,,,"strong, mature-tasting lager-like beer. Sweetish malty taste; quite nice and drinkable."
Wylam Haxan Black Wit,,,8,,,"hard to explain! Dark, fruity smell, fruity taste (raisins/dates?). Well rounded/balanced. Restrained bitterness, with any edge taken right off. This is a very enjoyable beer!"
Coast to Coast,,,6,,,had a cereal-like taste and was a bit sweet I think. Overall enjoyable.
Samuel Smith Lager,England,,6,,,"didn't taste of much but was very crisp, refreshing and fresh."
Samuel Smith IPA,England,,7,,,well rounded/balanced and of course hoppy. Very good.
Samuel Smith Extra Stout,England,,5,,,"the overall impression was bitterness which lingered in the mouth. Not keen to have it again, as, although it's not necessarily a bad beer per se, it was just a bit much for my taste."
Cauld Reekie,Scotland,,9,,,"rich, smooth stout with roasted flavour. Very well balanced, I'm very impressed - goes down an absolute treat."
First World Problems,Scotland,,7,,,good use of hops; quite a rich flavour. Has quite a strong bitter kick that my mouth adjusted to after a few glugs of the bottle. Overall seemed well rounded and full of character.
Contreras Mars,Belgium,,8,,,well balanced dubbel-like ale. Smooth with a rich satisfying taste.
Rochefort 6,Belgium,,9,,,amber coloured with a rich initial head. Fantastic balance with a nutty/fruity flavour and richness to it. Great stuff.
Island Oyster,England,,6,,,stout-ish beer with a light taste and pleasant roasted malt flavour. Nice.
Maisel's Weisse,Germany,,8,,,a very well-rounded wheat beer with the typical flavours but a cut above most.
Rhubarbe de Saison,England,,,,,annoyingly couldn't fully taste but it was cloudy and definitely had an obvious presence of rhubarb. Try it again!
Saison Cazeau,Belgium,,,,,couldn't fully taste but it was clear this is a quality saison. Must try again!
Epic Saison,England,,8,,,"despite man flu, got a good taste of this from 2 different tastings and was very impressed. Very moreish."
Troubadour Magma,Belgium,,8,,,rich strong IPA. Very good quality.
Housman Ale,England,,,,,
Revisionist Craft Lager,,,,,,
Beaverton Neck Oil,England,,,,,
Maule Lucky IPA,England,,,,,
Castle Milk Stout,South Africa,,,,,strong stuff; will need to try again to get the full flavour.
Torpedo,USA,,,,,
Peckham Pils,England,,,,,
Republika,,,7,,,seemed like a very decent lager.
Monteith IPA,New Zealand,,5,,,initial taste quite nice and fruity but overall it's unbalanced with too much weight on the bitterness.
Ghost Ship,England,,7,,,"light pale ale with fruity, cereal-like flavour. Very palatable and balanced."
Flensburger Pilsener,Germany,,7,,,"fresh, herbal, citrussy flavours. Quite bitter aftertaste but I found it very enjoyable."
I&G Wheat,Scotland,,7,,,Didn't taste like a standard wheat beer but pretty enjoyable stuff. Was it even wheat beer?
Marble IPA,,,7,,,"very well balanced IPA, with fruitiness, bitterness and a rich body - with a sort of cereal-like backbone."
Three Hop,Scotland,,6,,,quite thick lager with cereal flavour that dominates. Sweet.
BFM 225 Saison - Rhubarb,Switzerland,,,,,"slightly sour and full bodied, with obvious fruit presence. Must retry."
Cloudwater Keywoth's Mid Lager,England,,,,,
Siren Vanilla,England,,7,,,"sour and sweet with very obvious vanilla presence. The balance is very good. Overall refreshing and leaves a nice aftertaste, similar to nutty chocolate!"
Hitachino Red Rice,Japan,,8,,,"smooth, strong Belgian-style ale. A bit sweet and fruity. Overall caught me off guard and is pretty impressive stuff."
Rochmodis Kolsch,Germany,,7,,,"quite a fruity kolsch, not so malty like others. Quite enjoyable."
Beerbliotek Ginger,,,7,,,"watery, gingery, cereally. Actually very refreshing and nice. The lingering flavour is of cereal."
Beerbliotek Roses On Piano,,,7,,,"similar to the other one, with cereal finish but with a cranberry-like tart fruit flavour. Again, just as refreshing and enjoyable."
Beerbliotek Mint,,,6,,,"a bit like tart kriek mixed with mint. It's nice, no question, but I'm not so keen on mint so gets slightly less than the others."
Beerbliotek Pilsner,,,,,,tasted harsh and earthy after the Berliners. I think I'd rather try again as could be that the contrast made it unenjoyable.
All Day Session IPA,USA,,7,,,"great well rounded, well balanced refreshing IPA. Could easily drink several in one sitting."
Piraat,Belgium,,8,,,"amber coloured, quadrupel-like, spiced, hoppy flavour. Alcohol very well hidden and the taste overall is complex and rich. Yet another example of great Belgian brewing."
Cruzcampo (Draught),Spain,,7,,,"surprisingly good; slightly hoppy and creamy, and seemed like it was made for draught. Despite nothing exciting going on, thoroughly enjoyed it."
Erdinger Dunkel,Germany,,8,,,"nice wheat beer with slightly sweet, toasty flavour. Thoroughly enjoyable."
La Maricantana,Spain,,7,,,"great well rounded, well balanced refreshing IPA. Could easily drink several in one sitting."
? Quadrupel (Usher),,,8,,,"Strong, rich & sweet. Alcohol well disguised. Strong raisin/prune taste. Very good."
Coco Pops Stout (Usher),Scotland,,5,,,Dominated by a sweetish lactose taste. Cocoa flavour is there. Frankly ok.
Wheat Child of Mine (Usher),Scotland,,6,,,"Fruity, wheaty, full-bodied. Healthiest head of the lot. Bit of a bitter aftertaste but fine."
She's Stuck With Me (Usher),Scotland,,5,,,"IPA, a bit fruity but with a bitter kick. I think it's alright but a bit unbalanced."
Rancor (Usher),Scotland,,7,,,"Belgian dubbel. Rich, fruity taste. Straightforward flavour that you'd expect from this style, with not much complexity but quite good."
London Porter,England,,7,,,"In the glass, looked impeccable, like a wax sculpture. To taste: a good porter, smooth and very well balanced. Nice flavour too."
Red Pig,Mexico,,7,,,"Reddish in colour, with a creamy head. Overall a nice beer."
Pacifico,Mexico,,4,,,"Tasted a bit like lime, but probably because there was a slice of lime in it! That aside, a generic-tasting but refreshing lager."
Mexicali,Mexico,,6,,,"Described by the barman as ""like a Mexian 80 shilling"", this turned out to be almost that, a dark ""special"" beer that is a cut above the standard foreign imports."
Efes Pilsner,Turkey,,4,,,"Fairly generic pilsner. Quite drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary going on. Accompanies a kebab pretty well though! But, seriously: ""No. 1 Mediterranean beer""?!"
Fcuked,Scotland,,6,,,An unashamed blast of hops dominates this. It's a bit one dimensional but unpretentious and despite the bitterness is enjoyable.
Mytholm Mist,England,,6,,,"Mytholm Mist: cloudy, very carbonated wheat beer. The balance isn't perfect and the flavour is a balance of citrus and slightly bitter hops. Overall, it's an enjoyable brew."
Piraat,Belgium,,8,,,"amber coloured, quadrupel-like, spiced, hoppy flavour. Alcohol very well hidden and the taste overall is complex and rich. Yet another example of great Belgian brewing."
Holsten Alcohol Free,Germany,,5,,,has a pleasant malty/lagery taste. Won't win any world beer awards any time soon but I'd definitely drink it again.
Karmi Classic,Poland,,3,,,"impulse buy from a Polish shop, features Penelope Cruz on the label. Turns out this is a low ABV beer at 0.5% but doesn't bear much resemblance to actual beer. Smells a bit like wet dog mixed with brown sugar. Tastes like cold sugary coffee. While it's not terrible, I found it way too sweet and even Ms Cruz couldn't prevent it from being poured straight down the sink!"
Kozel Cerny,Czech Republic,,6,,,"light, crisp dark beer with hint of coffee in the flavour and a bit less boring than its light sibling. Despite the lack of excitement it's pleasant and refreshing. It reminds me of Coke but with the sugar removed."
Elvis Juice,Scotland,,7,,,"citrus IPA, tasted in Brew Dog, Edinburgh. Smells like grapefruit, and essentially tastes like an IPA mixed with grapefruit juice - but it's well balanced and the overall bitterness is well under control."
Hacker-Pschorr Weisse,Germany,,8,,,"With a big head, this is a smooth and rich beer with the typical flavours of banana, cloves etc that you'd normally find in this style. Perhaps a bit of spice as well. All in all, a great wheat beer."
