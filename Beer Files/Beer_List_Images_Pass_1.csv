Ours Pale Ale,France,De L'Ours,3,ours-doree;ours-noire,ours-doree,"Highly carbonated, this tastes a bit like the brewer chucked some water, malt, yeast etc into a bucket and hopes for the best.

Straffe Hendrik Quad,Belgium,Halve Maan,9,straffe-hendrik-quadrupel,straffe-hendrik-quadrupel,"Good head on this. The taste is that of rich dark fruits, and the 11% alcohol is very well hidden indeed. If it wasn't Wednesday I may have drank a second one. Excellent."
Monks Stout,Belgium,Dupont,6,,,"Quite a good, if watery stout with an earthy flavour."

Arran Blonde (Draught),Scotland,,7,arran-blonde;arran-clyde-puffer;arran-fireside;leven-blonde;sanda-blonde,,"has an earthiness/fruitiness about it. Body is smooth, with pleasant maltiness/citrus flavour. Pretty satisfying on draught, especially after climbing Goatfell!"
Haggis Hunter,Scotland,,6,,,"pleasant crisp ale with light fruitiness and bitterness, it's good but not outstanding."
La Rulles Brune,Belgium,,8,achel-brune;maredsous-brune;moinette-brune;st-feuillien-brune;tongerlo-brune,,"smooth, rich stout with a near perfect equilibrium of coffee bitterness, sweetness and agreeable acidity. I'm sure more tasting would reveal hidden depths but on this evidence, very impressed."
Hofbrau Muncher Weisse,Germany,,7,hofbrau-oktoberfest,,"nice wheat beer, with light banana presence. BB Dec 2014 but it was still nice and refreshing."
Skumenn Amber,France,,0,,,didn't have much but it was crisp and interesting.
Skumenn Rye IPA,France,,7,captain-moore-ipa,,"a strength like a strong Belgian ale, and with the qualities of a strong fruity IPA, this was very enjoyable and perhaps my favourite from Skumenn."
Arran Milestone,Scotland,,6,arran-blonde;arran-clyde-puffer;arran-fireside;milestone,,"strong amber ale, tastes like it was matured in casks of some kind. Taste is sweet and malty; the strong malty cereal flavour is promising but doesn't seem to go anywhere more interesting."
Arran Guid Ale,Scotland,,4,archerfield-golden-ale;arran-blonde;arran-clyde-puffer;arran-fireside;shg-pale-ale,,"bitterness dominates the taste here - in fact I think it's a bitter. Hint of fruitiness and passable, but I'm not really a fan."
Tempest Farmhouse,Scotland,,7,,,"very crisp, dirty, earthy taste, slightly sour. Interestingly tangy/citrussy. That combination of citrus and earthiness works pretty well and makes for a brew that is very interesting and quite satisfying."
Schneider Weisse Tap 5,Germany,,8,tap-4;tap-6,,"sweet, candy-like, alcohol well hidden, as expected. Rich and slightly malty, with a slight kick of hops. So smooth and pure tasting - be careful it creeps up on you!"
Hofbrau Dunkel,Germany,,6,hofbrau-oktoberfest,,"slightly sweet, with toasted malt flavour. Good but I imagine better if on draught/not 1.5 years past the use by date."
Hofbrau Schwarze Weisse,Germany,,7,hofbrau-oktoberfest,,"dark, crisp, malty, wheaty and well balanced. Enjoyable despite being so much past the use by date."

Barney's Red Rye,Scotland,,6,munich-red;red-eye-flight;red-squirrel,,"Smooth, creamy & malty, well defined flavour. Slightly bitter."
Schiehallion,Scotland,,7,schiehallion,schiehallion,
Estrella Damm,Spain,,5,estrella;inedit-damm;voll-damm,estrella,"Unexciting, basic lager but has a pleasant lingering malty finish and is a good thirst quencher."
Bersalis Kadet,Belgium,,7,,,"tastes triple-like, but weaker, slightly bitter and citrussy. Crisp, refreshing and tangy. Smooth yeastiness in the background? Overall quite satisfying."
Nitro Milk Stout,USA,,8,,,"very smooth, thin in consistency, but has a brilliantly balanced flavour of milky coffee and a hint of chocolate. Quality stuff."
Aventinus Eisbock,Germany,,8,,,"dark, smooth, rich, warming alcohol. Sweet flavour of marzipan/banana, spices. Quite alcoholic but still pleasantly so. Great beer."
Mongozo Buckwheat,Belgium,,7,,,"crisp, citrussy and refreshing, this pale beer hits the spot. Not particularly complex but the pleasant citrus taste is a success."
Kagua Red,Japan,,7,,,"rich, Belgian-style amber ale, fruity, slightly spicy (was that the wasabi?) and strong. All in all, a quality beer."
Kagua White,Japan,,8,hitachino-white-ale,,"lemony scent and very pale colour. Palate is crisp sweetness and refreshing, with hints of citrus. Tastes more like a strong, citrussy lager than a wheat beer to me. Overall I'm very impressed by how good this was."
Top Out South Face,Scotland,,6,top-out-porter (2);top-out-porter;top-out-winter-2015,,"red colour, rich head, fruity scent. Slightly fruity taste, bitterness in the aftertaste, strong but not overwhelming alcohol taste. Reminds me of The Cone. I think the strength is a little too much and this is almost a very good beer."
Imperialist,Belgium,,7,,,"foamy head which disappears quickly, and cloudy amber appearance like a wheat beer. Crisp, fizzy mouthfeel. Quite strong alcohol taste, yet quite flat in flavour. Overall though it's a nice flavour; a bit of citrus, a bit of caramel."
Windswept Wheat,Scotland,,8,,,"very cloudy, drinkable beer with strong banana smell/taste. Very I enjoyable."
Wooha(?) Wheat,Scotland,,8,,,"not a typical wheat beer, with hoppy bitterness/malts. It's interesting, well-balanced and a pleasure to drink."
Fallen Platform C,Scotland,,7,,,good well balanced IPA. The balance was key here.
West Dunkel,Scotland,,7,west-highland-way,,"enjoyable dark lager, went down a treat."
Byron Lager,England,,6,hells-lager;india-hells-lager,,straightforward lager as accompaniment to food. Good fizz/malt character. Fine by me.
Corsendonk Agnus Tripel,Belgium,,7,affligem-tripel;corsendonk-christmas;corsendonk-pater;duvel-tripel-hop;kasteel-tripel;westmalle-tripel,,"a decent tripel, don't remember the specifics."
Pundie,Scotland,,5,,,"light head, light body, interesting & unusual. Smells alcoholic. Slightly bitter, slightly strong alcohol taste. Overall enjoyable, with a grainy aroma/taste, but perhaps too strong and singularly bitter."
Krusovice Malvaz,Czech Republic,,7,,,"strong and amber-coloured, this is quite bitter but really well balanced and full of character. Very satisfying."
Krusovice Musketyr,Czech Republic,,6,,,"amber colour, with hoppy bitter taste and slight malt flavour. While not exciting the balance is good and the end result is satisfying."
Krosovice Wheat,Czech Republic,,6,,,"quite prominent banana small/taste, but a bit watery as a whole. That said, still an enjoyable beer."
Staropramen 11,Czech Republic,,7,,,"on draft, was well rounded with good character. Decent lager taste which was well balanced. Found it very enjoyable."
Kozel Cerny,Czech Republic,,6,kozel,,"light, crisp with hint of coffee, a bit less boring than its light sibling. Despite the lack of excitement it's pleasant and refreshing. It reminds me of Coke but with the sugar removed."
"Krusovice ""11""",Czech Republic,,6,,,pale ale-ish with malts in the flavour. Not exactly sure what this is but it's ok by me.
"Krusovice ""Black & Tan""",Czech Republic,,7,,,rich amber beer with nice malt character. Enjoyable! This is probably the 13.
??? Richnov ??? Marzen,Czech Republic,,8,,,"Crisp, malty, smooth amber ale. Faint bitterness but nice malt/sweet character and very enjoyable indeed!"
Chodovar Skalni Lezak,Czech Republic,,6,,,"amber beer with decent foamy head. Difficult to know what it is, but is crisp and lager-like with a nice malty character. Very drinkable."
The Pale Armadillo,Scotland,,7,shg-pale-ale;starlaw-pale;the-cone;the-ridge-or-jarl;will-o-the-wisp,,"cloudy yellow, hoppy and citrussy pale ale that is well-balanced. Enjoyable stuff."
Pissenlit,Belgium,,8,,,"tastes like other Fantomes I've had, it's citrussy and spicy with a strong amber colour and the alcohol is very well disguised. Can't really taste the dandelion but it's got a flavour full of character and doesn't disappoint!"
Gilden Kolsch,Germany,,6,fruh-kolsch;reissdorf-kolsch,,"less of a malt presence than other kolsch, but with a slight fruitiness. One of my less favourite but still ok."
Morgane,France,,6,,,"it had a healthy head and is cloudy with plenty sediment. As well as appearance, the flavour is similar to that of a wheat beer, with hints of banana etc. However, this has more of a cereal, barley-like taste than a wheat beer. At times, there's the sense of fizzy water in the mouth but generally, enjoyable enough."
Vanilla Shake,Denmark,,0,,,"unwittingly cracked this open on a Monday evening, not realising the % - it's very strong! Definite smell of coffee and vanilla. To taste it's a bit strong but gradually it becomes more drinkable. Rich coffee flavour with some vanilla and hint of chocolate. It's got a thick and creamy texture and hence lives up to its name."
No Label,Scotland,,6,lister-no-8,,tastes more like a pale ale to me than a kolsch. Subtle hops and fruitiness combine to make a refreshing but confused-tasting beer. I feel the maltiness that should be in a kolsch is mainly washed away by the fruit flavour.
Northbound 08,North Ireland,,7,,,subtle flavour but very crisp and satisfying.
Wooha Lager,Scotland,,7,,,"very unusual, cloudy with fruity smell and earthy, slightly bitter, malty taste. I enjoyed it, certainly interesting and unique."
Czech Craft Lager,Czech Republic,,7,,,"strong well-balanced lager, with hint of sweetness. Satisfying."
Angelo Poretti,Italy,,6,,,"Whistle Binkies, draft. Decent lager, but don't remember much more."
Pelicon Stout,Slovenia,,6,,,"coffee aroma with coffee taste and a slight creaminess, although a bit thin. Overall quite nice."
St Giles,Scotland,,7,st-mungo,,decent 80 shilling-style ale. Good malt character and enjoyable to drink.
85 Shilling,Scotland,,6,,,"dark with rich creamy head, coffee/smoky/dark malty taste. Threatens to be something special."
Cranachan Stout,Scotland,,8,black-ball-stout;brewdog-milk-stout;shg-stout,,"tart raspberry flavour combined with whisky flavours. Rich and strong in alcohol yet the balance on this is great. Can't fault it, I want more!"
Bad Day At the Office,Scotland,,6,the-cone;the-ridge-or-jarl;will-o-the-wisp,,"good, but not great, amber hoppy ale (bitter?). Perfectly ok."
Talisman,Scotland,,7,,,"crisp, light & refreshing lager with a bit of citrus. Enjoyable."
Golf Inn,Scotland,,6,unknown-sun-inn;unknown2-sun-inn,,fruity/bitter/hoppy combo in a nicely balanced ale. Well made but not exciting.
Innis & Gunn Lager,Scotland,,6,innis-gunn-rum,,"decent, slight fruity lager. Very drinkable. Rather nice."
Leffe Brune,Belgium,,6,achel-brune;leffe-blonde;maredsous-brune;moinette-brune;st-feuillien-brune;tongerlo-brune,,"decent strong brown ale, but had a sweetish, slightly industrial taste which let it down slightly."

Samuel Smith IPA,England,,7,samuel-smith-imperial-stout;samuel-smith-nut-brown;samuel-smith-pale;hackney-ipa;samuel-smiths-wheat,,well rounded/balanced and of course hoppy. Very good.
Samuel Smith Extra Stout,England,,5,samuel-smith-imperial-stout;samuel-smith-nut-brown;samuel-smith-pale;samuel-smiths-wheat,,"the overall impression was bitterness which lingered in the mouth. Not keen to have it again, as, although it's not necessarily a bad beer per se, it was just a bit much for my taste."
Cauld Reekie,Scotland,,9,,,"rich, smooth stout with roasted flavour. Very well balanced, I'm very impressed - goes down an absolute treat."
First World Problems,Scotland,,7,,,good use of hops; quite a rich flavour. Has quite a strong bitter kick that my mouth adjusted to after a few glugs of the bottle. Overall seemed well rounded and full of character.
Contreras Mars,Belgium,,8,,,well balanced dubbel-like ale. Smooth with a rich satisfying taste.
Rochefort 6,Belgium,,9,rochefort-6;rochefort-8,,amber coloured with a rich initial head. Fantastic balance with a nutty/fruity flavour and richness to it. Great stuff.
Island Oyster,England,,6,,,stout-ish beer with a light taste and pleasant roasted malt flavour. Nice.
Maisel's Weisse,Germany,,8,,,a very well-rounded wheat beer with the typical flavours but a cut above most.
Rhubarbe de Saison,England,,0,,,annoyingly couldn't fully taste but it was cloudy and definitely had an obvious presence of rhubarb. Try it again!
Saison Cazeau,Belgium,,0,saison-dupont-biologique;saison-dupont;silly-saison,,couldn't fully taste but it was clear this is a quality saison. Must try again!

Flensburger Pilsener,Germany,,7,,,"fresh, herbal, citrussy flavours. Quite bitter aftertaste but I found it very enjoyable."
I&G Wheat,Scotland,,7,,,Didn't taste like a standard wheat beer but pretty enjoyable stuff. Was it even wheat beer?

BFM 225 Saison - Rhubarb,Switzerland,,0,,,"slightly sour and full bodied, with obvious fruit presence. Must retry."
Cloudwater Keywoth's Mid Lager,England,,0,hells-lager;india-hells-lager,,
Siren Vanilla,England,,7,,,"sour and sweet with very obvious vanilla presence. The balance is very good. Overall refreshing and leaves a nice aftertaste, similar to nutty chocolate!"

Rochmodis Kolsch,Germany,,7,fruh-kolsch;reissdorf-kolsch,,"quite a fruity kolsch, not so malty like others. Quite enjoyable."
All Day Session IPA,USA,,7,goose-island-ipa,,"great well rounded, well balanced refreshing IPA. Could easily drink several in one sitting."

Cruzcampo (Draught),Spain,,7,cruzcampo,,"surprisingly good; slightly hoppy and creamy, and seemed like it was made for draught. Despite nothing exciting going on, thoroughly enjoyed it."
Erdinger Dunkel,Germany,,8,erdinger,,"nice wheat beer with slightly sweet, toasty flavour. Thoroughly enjoyable."
La Maricantana,Spain,,7,la-socarrada,,"great well rounded, well balanced refreshing IPA. Could easily drink several in one sitting."
Coco Pops Stout (Usher),Scotland,,5,black-ball-stout;brewdog-milk-stout;shg-stout,,Dominated by a sweetish lactose taste. Cocoa flavour is there. Frankly ok.
Wheat Child of Mine (Usher),Scotland,,6,colony-of-artists,,"Fruity, wheaty, full-bodied. Healthiest head of the lot. Bit of a bitter aftertaste but fine."
She's Stuck With Me (Usher),Scotland,,5,,,"IPA, a bit fruity but with a bitter kick. I think it's alright but a bit unbalanced."
Rancor (Usher),Scotland,,7,,,"Belgian dubbel. Rich, fruity taste. Straightforward flavour that you'd expect from this style, with not much complexity but quite good."
London Porter,England,,7,plum-porter,,"In the glass, looked impeccable, like a wax sculpture. To taste: a good porter, smooth and very well balanced. Nice flavour too."
Red Pig,Mexico,,7,,,"Reddish in colour, with a creamy head. Overall a nice beer."
Pacifico,Mexico,,4,,,"Tasted a bit like lime, but probably because there was a slice of lime in it! That aside, a generic-tasting but refreshing lager."
Mexicali,Mexico,,6,,,"Described by the barman as ""like a Mexian 80 shilling"", this turned out to be almost that, a dark ""special"" beer that is a cut above the standard foreign imports."
Efes Pilsner,Turkey,,4,efes-draft,,"Fairly generic pilsner. Quite drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary going on. Accompanies a kebab pretty well though! But, seriously: ""No. 1 Mediterranean beer""?!"
Fcuked,Scotland,,6,,,An unashamed blast of hops dominates this. It's a bit one dimensional but unpretentious and despite the bitterness is enjoyable.
Mytholm Mist,England,,6,,,"Mytholm Mist: cloudy, very carbonated wheat beer. The balance isn't perfect and the flavour is a balance of citrus and slightly bitter hops. Overall, it's an enjoyable brew."
Piraat,Belgium,,8,,,"amber coloured, quadrupel-like, spiced, hoppy flavour. Alcohol very well hidden and the taste overall is complex and rich. Yet another example of great Belgian brewing."
Holsten Alcohol Free,Germany,,5,,,has a pleasant malty/lagery taste. Won't win any world beer awards any time soon but I'd definitely drink it again.
Karmi Classic,Poland,,3,,,"impulse buy from a Polish shop, features Penelope Cruz on the label. Turns out this is a low ABV beer at 0.5% but doesn't bear much resemblance to actual beer. Smells a bit like wet dog mixed with brown sugar. Tastes like cold sugary coffee. While it's not terrible, I found it way too sweet and even Ms Cruz couldn't prevent it from being poured straight down the sink!"
Kozel Cerny,Czech Republic,,6,kozel,,"light, crisp dark beer with hint of coffee in the flavour and a bit less boring than its light sibling. Despite the lack of excitement it's pleasant and refreshing. It reminds me of Coke but with the sugar removed."
Elvis Juice,Scotland,,7,,,"citrus IPA, tasted in Brew Dog, Edinburgh. Smells like grapefruit, and essentially tastes like an IPA mixed with grapefruit juice - but it's well balanced and the overall bitterness is well under control."
Hacker-Pschorr Weisse,Germany,,8,,,"With a big head, this is a smooth and rich beer with the typical flavours of banana, cloves etc that you'd normally find in this style. Perhaps a bit of spice as well. All in all, a great wheat beer."
